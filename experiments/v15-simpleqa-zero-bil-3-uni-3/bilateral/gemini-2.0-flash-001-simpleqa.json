described as a light multipurpose aircraft T-101 named Grach.\n2.  **Design Basis:** The aircraft is said to be based on the AN-2 biplane.\n3.  **Designer:** The AN-2 design is attributed to Evgeny Grunin (should be correct name or design bureau).\n4.  **First Flight Date:** The first flight date is stated as December 7, 1994.\n5.  **Height:** The aircraft's height is given as 4.50 meters.\n\nVerification:\n\n1.  **T-101 Grach:** A search confirms the existence of a T-101 Grach multipurpose aircraft.\n2.  **Based on AN-2:** Sources indicate the T-101 was designed as a modern replacement for the AN-2, which suggests a connection but not necessarily \"based on.\" (This might also mean inspiration)\n3.  **Designer of AN-2:** The AN-2 was designed by Oleg Antonov, not Evgeny Grunin. Searches for Evgeny Grunin related to T-101 aircraft yield very minimal results.\n4.  **First Flight Date:** Some sources claim the first flight was December 7, 1994.\n5.  **Height:** Preliminary searches found conflicting values for the height. Some source state that the height is similar as AN-2 (4.1-4.2m). Other sources say the plane height is 4.5m. The fact that this varies makes it slightly less reliable.\n\nConclusion:\n\nSince the designer of the AN-2 is incorrectly identified, at least one essential claim is false.\n\nCANNOT VERIFY\n", "To determine if the answer is definitively true, we need to verify the height of the T-101 Grach aircraft.\n\nSeveral sources and forums online mention the general description of the T-101 Grach and its development based on the An-2, and that it was designed by Evgeny Grunin with a first flight in December 1994. However, reliable sources specifying the exact height as 4.50m are not readily available through quick search.\n\nTherefore, I cannot definitively confirm that the height is exactly 4.50m without further verification.\n\nCANNOT VERIFY\n", "Let's analyze the question and the answer. We need to verify the height of the T-101 Grach aircraft.\n\nI searched extensively for information about the T-101 Grach, including its specifications and height. I found information confirming that the aircraft exists (or existed as a project) and that it's based on the An-2.  However, finding a reliable source stating its precise height as 4.50m is difficult. Some sources mention its connection to the An-2, which has a height around 4.17 m, but it's important to note they are not the same aircraft, and therefore that measurement is not proof of the T-101's height.\n\nSince I cannot find a reliable source confirming the 4.50m height, I cannot definitively verify the answer.\n\nCANNOT VERIFY\n"], "refutation": ["CANNOT REFUTE\n", "CANNOT REFUTE\n",

The provided answer states that he won the stadion and diaulos in 521 BCE alongside the hoplitodromos. This contradicts the commonly accepted knowledge that Phanas won the stadion in 520 BCE. Furthermore, there is no supporting information about Phanas winning the diaulos or hoplitodromos at any time.\n\nCANNOT VERIFY\n", "The claim is that Phanas of Pellene won the stadion and diaulos in the 521 BCE Olympics, in addition to the hoplitodromos.\n\nAccording to olympic.org, \"The first Games also included just one athletic event, a foot race of approximately 192 metres called the stadion. In 776 BC, Coroebus, a cook from Elis, won the stadion race and became the first Olympic champion in recorded history.\" This confirms the existence of the stadion race.\n\nRegarding the diaulos, \"the double-stadion race (diaulos) was added in 724 BC.\" This confirms the existence of the diaulos race.\n\nHowever, whether Phanas of Pellene won these races in 521 BCE along with the hoplitodromos needs further confirmation. No single source definitively states that Phanas won all three events (stadion, diaulos, hoplitodromos) in the 521 BCE Olympics. While some sources mention his victory in the hoplitodromos, they do not specify his wins in the stadion and diaulos in the same games.\n\nTherefore, the answer is not definitively true without further and specific evidentiary support.\n\nCANNOT VERIFY\n", "The question asks about Phanas of Pellene's wins in the 521 BCE Olympics *besides* the hoplitodromos. The answer claims he won the stadion and diaulos. Since the question requires information beyond what's explicitly stated in readily available sources, it's difficult to definitively confirm. We can confirm that Phanas of Pellene *did* win the stadion race at the 520 BCE Olympic Games (not 521 BCE; this is already a discrepancy). There is no record that confirms he also won the diaulos or any other event in that particular Olympiad.\n\nCANNOT VERIFY\n"], "refutation": ["CANNOT REFUTE\n", "CANNOT REFUTE\n", "REFUTED\n"],

The answer provided is 1927.\n\nWe can search for \"Otton Nikodym unit square area 1 single point intersection line 1927\".\nSearching for \"Nikodym set\" reveals it is a subset of R^n with Lebesgue measure zero which contains a point on every line.\nOtton Martin Nikodym published \"Sur la mesure des ensembles plans dont tous les points sont rectilign\u00e9ment accessibles\" in Fundamenta Mathematicae, Volume 10 in 1927. This paper constructs a set of measure zero that contains a point on every line through a certain point. This is related to the Nikodym set which has measure zero.\n\nThe question asks about a set N of area(N) = 1 with intersection of a line at a single point. This is different from the standard Nikodym sets which have measure zero.\nThe statement of the question seems to be a bit different from what Nikodym actually achieved.\nThe common Nikodym set has measure zero, not measure 1. So, there is a mismatch.\n\nGiven the available information, I cannot definitively verify if Nikodym proved the existence of a set N in 1927 as described in the question, as the more common formulation of Nikodym sets have a measure of 0, not 1.\n\nCANNOT VERIFY\n", "The claim is that Otton Nikodym showed how to produce a subset N of the unit square with area(N) = 1 such that for each point x \u2208 N there is a line intersecting N in the single point x in the year 1927.\n\nLet's verify this statement. The Nikodym set construction is related to the problem. Based on historical records and mathematical literature, the Nikodym set construction and associated results are attributed to Otton Nikodym and are generally associated with the year 1927 or in that
