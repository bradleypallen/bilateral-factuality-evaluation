It was discovered in 2016 and is a known exoplanet within 10 parsecs.\n\n2. **Size of Proxima Centauri b**: Proxima Centauri b is estimated to be similar in size to Earth, meaning it is not exceptionally small compared to many other exoplanets.\n\n3. **Smaller Exoplanets within 10 Parsecs**: As of 2022, the wider astronomical community has identified smaller exoplanets, often sub-Neptune or smaller, within 10 parsecs. Examples include planets orbiting TRAPPIST-1, such as TRAPPIST-1e and TRAPPIST-1d, which are likely smaller than Proxima Centauri b and are well within 10 parsecs (TRAPPIST-1 is about 12 light-years away, approximately 3.7 parsecs).\n\nGiven that there are smaller confirmed exoplanets within 10 parsecs than Proxima Centauri b, the claim that Proxima Centauri b is the smallest known exoplanet within this distance is indeed false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\n\"REFUTED\"", "Proxima Centauri b is an exoplanet that orbits the star Proxima Centauri, which is approximately 1.3 parsecs away from Earth.

As of 2022, smaller exoplanets have likely been discovered within this range, such as those detected by the Kepler and TESS missions, even if they are more challenging to study due to their size or other characteristics.

The disease is X-linked recessive, which typically affects males more often, and given the question provides no direct maternal link from the Wittelsbachs to Elisabeth involving hemophilia, it would have been unlikely for her to inherit it from them.\n\n3. **Karl K\u00fcchler's Hypothesis:** There is no well-known theory by a person named Karl K\u00fcchler stating that Empress Elisabeth or members of the Habsburgs suffered more from a hereditary disease due to the Wittelsbachs beyond what's known about hemophilia.\n\nTherefore, considering these points, \"Hemophilia\" as an answer to a hereditary disease from the House of Wittelsbach affecting Empress Elisabeth lacks direct historical or genetic foundation.

One key aspect of the prize is that it involves optimizing the compression of a particular dataset, where the baseline measurement is typically the gzip compressed size of that dataset.\n\nThe commonly used dataset for this purpose is the large corpus of text data, often measured as the Limpopo corpus. The breakthrough typically involves compressing this dataset to a size that is smaller than the \"baseline\" gzip result.\n\nHistorically, the accepted \"baseline\" for the Hutter Prize is around 17 MB (or 17,073,018 bytes) for the earlier competitions. Given that Alexander Ratushnyak won the first Hutter Prize in 2006, the baseline itself would logically be what the competition started from, implying this was the baseline rather than a new baseline set after winning.\n\nThus, the statement \"17,073,018 bytes is the new baseline set after Alexander Ratushnyak won the first time the Hutter Prize was awarded in 2006\" contains a contradiction because that value represents the original baseline, not a new baseline set by his achievement.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\nREFUTED"], "evaluation": "f"}, {"metadata": {"topic": "Science and technology", "answer_type": "Date", "urls": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChromeOS", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChromeOS#:~:text=In%20June%202010%2C%20Google's%20software,resemble%20Microsoft's%20Remote%20Desktop%20Connection.", "https://www.ijraset.com/fileserve.php?FID=987", "https://yourstudent-gemini.fandom.com/wiki/Chrome_OS"]}, "problem": "What were the month and year when Google's software engineer Gary Ka\u010dmar\u010d\u00edk wrote that ChromeOS would access remote applications through a technology unofficially called \"Chromoting\"?", "answer": "June 2010", "label": "t", "model_name": "microsoft/phi-4", "timestamp": "2025-03-04T09:29:00.420443+00:00", "verification": ["CANNOT VERIFY - The information about Gary Ka\u010dmar\u010d\u00edk's statement regarding \"Chromoting\" in June 2010 cannot be independently verified without access to specific sources or documentation that confirm this claim.

By the age of 23, he was in the late 1920s. In the early stages of his career, Calloway was a singer, dancer, bandleader, and entertainer in the jazz scene.

The amount of $30,000 was considered substantial then, often comparable to the earnings of a very successful individual or professional.\n\nGiven this context, it is reasonable to conclude that the specific figure of $30,000 for how much Cab Calloway was making at the age of 23 is excessively high for the timeframe and his career stage at that time.\n\nTherefore, the answer can be concluded as:\n\nREFUTED", "To determine if the answer is definitively false, we need to consider available historical data about Cab Calloway's earnings as a young performer.

The most significant ODSs include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). Nitrous oxide (N2O) is considered an ODS but is not controlled by the Montreal Protocol due to its dual roles as a powerful greenhouse gas and its indirect effect on ozone depletion through the release of nitrogen oxides in the stratosphere.\n\n2. **Emissions Comparison**: \n   - Historically, CFCs, HCFCs, halons, and other controlled substances under the Montreal Protocol had much higher emissions and more direct impacts on ozone depletion compared to nitrous oxide.\n   - Nitrous oxide emissions are primarily from agricultural activities, fossil fuel combustion, and industrial processes.

Its impact on the ozone layer comes from its breakdown in the stratosphere into nitrogen oxides, which can then participate in ozone destruction. However, its potency and direct impact as an ODS compared to CFCs and other halogenated compounds is relatively lower.\n\n3. **Historical Data**: By the 1980s and 1990s, major efforts through international agreements like the Montreal Protocol significantly reduced the emissions of the most harmful ODS, especially CFCs. By 2006, the recovery of the ozone layer was observed due to the reduction of these substances.\n\n4. **Scientific Consensus**: The consensus among scientists is that CFCs and halons were historically the largest ODS in terms of ozone depletion potential (ODP) and impact.\n\nBased on these points, nitrous oxide, although significant as a greenhouse gas and with some impact on ozone, was not the largest ODS emitted through human activities by 2006.

By the late 20th and early 21st century, emissions of these substances were reduced due to the Montreal Protocol and its amendments.\n   - Nitrous oxide, while a significant greenhouse gas and ozonemodifying substance, is considered less impactful in ozone depletion compared to CFCs and halons.\n\n2. **Nitrous Oxide Emissions**: \n   - N2O is primarily released from agricultural activities, industrial processes, and biomass burning.

These substances were heavily regulated and phased out under the Montreal Protocol.\n\n2. **Nitrous Oxide**: While nitrous oxide is indeed an ozone-depleting substance, it has never been the largest ODS emitted by human activities. Its global warming potential is significant, but its ozone depletion potential is lower compared to CFCs and halons.\n\n3. **Regulatory Changes**: By 2006, the phase-out of CFCs and halons was well underway due to international agreements. However, these substances, due to their longer atmospheric lifetimes, continued to have a significant presence in the atmosphere.\n\n4. **Emission Trends**: Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) were the largest ODS emitted due to their use as replacements for CFCs. They were later targeted for phase-out as well.\n\nGiven this information, nitrous oxide was not the largest ozone-depleting substance emitted through human activities by 2006 or at any other time.

These substances were the largest contributors to ozone depletion prior to significant reductions due to global regulatory actions.\n\n2. **Role of Nitrous Oxide**: Nitrous oxide (N\\(_2\\)O) is a naturally occurring gas that also acts as a potent greenhouse gas. It contributes to both ozone depletion and global warming. However, its impact on ozone depletion is generally considered secondary compared to the synthetic CFCs and halons mentioned earlier.\n\n3. **Trends Post-Montreal Protocol**: Since the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, the production and emission of CFCs and other ozone-depleting halocarbons have significantly decreased due to international regulation. By the early 21st century, these chemicals were largely phased out. By contrast, nitrous oxide emissions, primarily from agricultural activities (e.g., use of nitrogen-based fertilizers), have not been regulated under the Protocol and have continued to rise.\n\n4. **Current Understanding**: Scientific assessments, including those by the IPCC and research in atmospheric chemistry, indicate that by the 2000s, nitrous oxide had emerged as the most significant human-influenced ozone-depleting substance due to ongoing emissions, despite lower ozone depletion potential per molecule compared to CFCs.\n\nGiven these points, the statement that by 2006 nitrous oxide was the largest ozone-depleting substance emitted through human activities aligns with current scientific understanding.

Moreover, its contribution to ozone depletion is generally less than that of CFCs and halons, both naturally and through regulation under the Montreal Protocol.\n\nHistorically, CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) were the largest contributors to ozone depletion due to their abundance in industrial applications like refrigeration, air conditioning, and aerosol propellants before their phase-out.\n\nNitrous oxide began to be identified as a significant ozone-depleting substance more prominently in later years, as the focus shifted towards controlling other ODSs. Numerous studies and reports following the early 2000s indicate an increasing understanding of N\u2082O's role in ozone depletion.

This council is responsible for issuing religious edicts and providing religious guidance.\n\n2. **Codification of Sharia Law**: Historically, Saudi Arabia has not codified Sharia law in the way some other Islamic nations have, as it bases its legal system directly on Sharia. However, there have been efforts to formalize aspects of its legal system formally through royal orders and government resolutions.\n\n3. **Yearly Context**: In 2007, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia issued a royal decree calling for the codification of several laws, including civil, commercial, and procedural laws to have a more defined legal framework.

In the early 2000s, Saudi Arabia did indeed undertake a process to codify Sharia law, culminating in 'The Compilation of the Sources of Islamic Law (Al-Mujamma' al-Fiqhi al-Kuwaiti)'. This compilation, aimed at developing a more coherent legal framework, was approved by a royal decree on August 29, 2010, rather than 2008.\n\nGiven this information, the claim that the top religious body in Saudi Arabia gave the green light for codification of Sharia law in 2008 is not accurate for the following reasons: the official approval was granted in 2010, and no specific independent approval by the Council of Senior Scholars in 2008 is documented separately from the 2010 royal decree.\n\nHence, the answer to the question is:\n\n\"CANNOT VERIFY\" - If any essential claim cannot be verified"], "refutation": ["To determine whether the answer \"2008\" is definitively false for the question about when the top religious body in Saudi Arabia gave the green light for codification of Sharia law, we need to consider the known historical context.\n\nThe Council of Senior Religious Scholars (also known as the Permanent Committee for Scientific Research and Legal Opinions) is a key religious body in Saudi Arabia responsible for issuing fatwas and providing religious guidelines. While Saudi Arabia has Sharia as a foundational element of its legal system, the formal codification efforts have been ongoing and not tied to a specific date that can be widely recognized as \"2008\".\n\nAs of the available information, there is no well-documented or widely recognized event or decision in 2008 by Saudi Arabia's top religious body specifically granting approval for the codification of Sharia law. While Sharia has always been a core part of Saudi law, specific codification efforts have been more gradual and distributed over time without a singular green light given in a specific year like 2008.\n\nThus, without specific evidence or records to contradict or confirm the claim, the statement \"2008\" cannot be definitively declared false based on available historical documentation. Therefore, the conclusion is:\n\n\"CANNOT REFUTE\"", "To evaluate whether the answer \"2008\" is definitively FALSE for the question regarding the year the top religious body in Saudi Arabia gave the green light for codification of Sharia law, we can look at known information.\n\n- Saudi Arabia does not have a written constitution or codified laws in the same sense as many other countries. Instead, it follows Islamic law (Sharia) as interpreted by the country's religious authorities.\n  \n- In recent years, specifically by 2010 under then-Crown Prince Salman, there was a move to codify parts of Sharia law into a unified code, which was seen as a significant modernization effort. \n\n- This effort led to the publication of the \"Saudi Arabia\u2019s Unified National Legislation\" in stages, with the criminal code, legislative regulations, and evidence law issued in 2018.\n\nBased on this, the year 2008 does not align with the known timeline for codification efforts of Sharia into national legislation in Saudi Arabia. Thus, the statement that the top religious body gave approval in 2008 can be considered definitively false based on what is known about the timeline.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\nREFUTED", "To determine if the answer \"2008\" is definitively false for the question regarding when the top religious body in Saudi Arabia gave the green light for the codification of Sharia law, we must examine historical records and available information.\n\nSaudi Arabia does not have a formal process for codifying Sharia law comparable to other legal systems. The country's legal framework is based on a mixture of the Quran, Hadith, and other Islamic legal sources, interpreted by judges without a written code.

Great Apes include gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and bonobos, each of which have specific habitats.\n\n2. **Known UNESCO Sites with Great Apes**: Great Apes are primarily found in a few regions across Africa and Southeast Asia. Notable UNESCO sites known to include Great Apes are:\n   - **Virunga National Park** (DRC), known for mountain gorillas.\n   - **Bwindi Impenetrable National Park** (Uganda), known for mountain gorillas.\n   - **Kaziranga National Park** (India), known for its diverse wildlife, which can include some IUCN listings but not specifically Great Apes.\n   - **Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park** (Indonesia), where Sumatran orangutans live.\n   - **Gunung Leuser National Park** (Indonesia), also hosting Sumatran orangutans.\n   - **Tangkoko-Balimbing Natural Park** (Indonesia), home to the Tapanuli orangutan.\n   - Other African national parks and rainforests, such as **Kahuzi-Biega National Park** (DRC) for eastern lowland gorillas, and others involving chimpanzee habitats in West/Central Africa.\n\n3. **Number of Sites**: It\u2019s important to check whether these types of sites add up to more or less than 34.

However, general trends from the census data indicate that languages like Bengali, Marathi, and Gujarati have significant numbers of speakers, but the growth rate is more relevant to this question.\n\n2. **Language Growth**: The growth rate of a language is typically measured by the increase in the number of speakers over a decade. According to data interpretations from the 2011 Census, languages such as Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, and Punjabi saw significant growth, but the exact order can vary based on different sources and interpretations.\n\n3. **Specific Order**: The question specifies a particular order: Hindi, Meitei (Manipuri), Bengali. This order is not commonly cited in available public census data as a ranked list of fastest-growing languages. However, Bengali is often cited as one of the fastest-growing languages due to its large number of speakers and natural increase.\n\nGiven the information:\n\n- The question suggests a specific order where Bengali is the fourth fastest growing, which contradicts common interpretations that place Bengali higher in growth rankings.\n- Gujarati is a plausible candidate for one of the fastest-growing languages, but the specific rank given in the question does not align with commonly available data.\n\nSince the question provides a specific order that does not align with typical interpretations of census data, and Gujarati could still be among the fastest-growing languages, the answer \"Gujarati\" is not definitively false based on the information given.\n\nConclusion: \"CANNOT REFUTE\" - If no definitive contradiction exists.", "To evaluate the statement, we need to verify the ranking of language growth according to the 2011 census of India.

However, it often makes the resulting ceramic more fusible, requiring higher temperatures to fire to maturity, which is considered an undesirable trait when trying to maintain certain properties of the clay.\n\nKaolin, on the other hand, is a type of clay mineral that is also used to modify the properties of clays, particularly in ceramics.
