But this is not the title 'president'.\n\nHowever, Isabel Per\u00f3n of Argentina was the first non-monarchical female head of state to take the title 'president', but she did not win it in a democratic election; she became the president following the death of her husband.\n\nMaria de Lourdes Pintasilgo was the first woman to be elected as the president of Portugal in 1979 but that was an acting president for an interim period, following the resignation of Ant\u00f3nio Ramalho Eanes.\n\nHowever, the answer 'Iceland' can be seen as correct but there is another country also electing a female president prior to that. This is Sirimavo's daughter's, Chandrika Kumaratunga, is not correct, she won the presidential election in 1994, therefore Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir of Iceland is the first democratically elected female head of state, and also as the first with the title 'president' in a country with a similar presidential role to some other countries.\n\nHowever, it appears there is a female president elected prior to that in a country, which is the first democratically elected female president in the world. That is, Ertha Pascal-Trouillot of Haiti, who got elected as interim president of Haiti in 1990, however that is after Vigd\u00eds. \n\nBut another female president, who got elected prior to Vigd\u00eds, that is Sirimavo's daughter is not correct but another one is correct, that is, Mar\u00eda Estela Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n (also known as Isabel Per\u00f3n) of Argentina became president following the death of her husband in 1974 and won the prior election as vice president, but that is not a direct election.

The electron configuration for Indium is [Kr] 4d10 5s2 5p1. However, when considering the electron configuration given in the question [Ar] 4s2 3d10 4p1, it seems that the core [Ar] is used instead of [Kr] which is the correct core for Indium, and the d and s subshells seem to be inconsistent.\n\nHowever, another element that has the atomic number 30 is Zinc (Zn) which doesn't match the given electron configuration either, but for the atomic number 30-1
