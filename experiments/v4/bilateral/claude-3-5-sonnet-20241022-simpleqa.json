Historical Context:\n- Pakistan became independent in 1947\n- The National Assembly was established after independence\n- Multiple sources would need to be cross-referenced to establish the exact order of deputy speakers\n\n4. Data Limitations:\n- Complete historical records of early Pakistani parliamentary positions can be difficult to verify\n- Multiple reliable sources would be needed to confirm he was specifically the third person in this role\n- While Gibbon's service is documented, confirming his position as specifically the third deputy speaker requires additional verification\n\n5.
