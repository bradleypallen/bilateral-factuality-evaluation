The question does not mention any missing information that is essential.\n\nThe question asks for the location of the International Congress of Mathematicians, and the answer provided is Beijing, China.  To verify this, we would need to find evidence that the International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Beijing, China, and that Vladimir Voevodsky was awarded his Fields Medal at that event.  Without such evidence, we cannot definitively verify the answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer \"Beijing, China\" CANNOT DETERMINE TRUE.", "falsification": "\nReasoning steps:\n1.

The Fields Medal was awarded to Vladimir Voevodsky in 2002 in Madrid, Spain, not Beijing, China. The International Congress of Mathematicians was also held in Madrid that year.", "evaluation": "f"}]
