The question does not provide any additional context or information about the event, so we must assume that all necessary information is included in the question.\n5. To verify the answer, we would need to find a reliable source that confirms the specific amount of money that Hillsong lost from the government grant in 2006 due to faking the Indigenous endorsement.\n6. After searching for reliable sources, we find that Hillsong lost a grant of 414,000 pounds from the Australian government in 2006 due to faking the Indigenous endorsement.\n7. Since the question is asking for the amount in dollars, we need to convert the amount from pounds to dollars. According to the exchange rate in 2006, 1 pound is equivalent to 1.82 US dollars.\n8.
