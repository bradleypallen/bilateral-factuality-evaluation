Verifying each claim against known facts:\n\u2003\u2022 Reliable historical sources give detailed chronologies of Gibbs\u2019s life. Born in 1839, Gibbs is most famous for his thermodynamics papers published later in his career (for example, his work on \u201cOn the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances\u201d appeared in the mid-1870s when he would have been in his mid-30s). In contrast, for his \u201cfirst work\u201d there is no broad consensus in easily accessible sources that he published at age 28. Some biographies suggest that his earlier work may have been published when he was younger, but the record on the exact age of his first publication is not consistently referenced.\n\u2003\nStep 3. Identifying unstated assumptions:\n\u2003\u2022 The answer assumes that there is a definitive identification of \u201cfirst published work\u201d and that all sources agree on the age of 28, without any qualification.\n\u2003\nStep 4. Temporal/contextual dependencies:\n\u2003\u2022 The determination depends on which work qualifies as \u201chis first work\u201d (for example, an early minor paper versus a later seminal work) and on historical documentation. There is variation and some ambiguity in the literature.\n\u2003\nStep 5. Validating logical connections:\n\u2003\u2022 Without widely accepted historical confirmation that Gibbs published his first work at the age of 28, the answer depends on a claim that is not independently verifiable given the known discrepancies in the sources.\n\nBecause there isn\u2019t an uncontroversial, independently verified fact that Gibbs was exactly 28 when he published his first work, we must conclude that the answer \u201c28\u201d cannot be definitively verified.\n\nCANNOT VERIFY"], "refutation": ["I\u2019ll explain my reasoning step\u2010by\u2010step.\n\n1.

However, based on widely available sources and the timeline in Gibbs\u2019s biography, there isn\u2019t a clear and widely accepted documented contradiction stating that his first publication occurred at an age other than 28.\n\n3. I double\u2010checked the logical consistency. For example, if he were born in 1839, then age 28 would be 1867; some biographical details suggest he began publishing in his late 20s. There isn\u2019t an unmistakable internal logic issue or an \u201cimpossible condition\u201d seen with the claim \u201c28.\u201d\n\n4. I looked for any mutually exclusive historical facts.
