Logical Analysis:\n- It would be impossible for an asteroid discovered in 1961 to have \"1994\" as part of its official designation\n- The naming convention for asteroids follows strict rules where the year prefix indicates the discovery year\n- Therefore, an asteroid called \"1994 Shane\" could not have been discovered in 1961\n\n4.

Historical Research:\n* The Cape Town Cycle Tour (formerly Cape Argus) started in 1978\n* The route has maintained a fairly consistent distance of roughly 109 km since early in its history\n* The official distance of the race in 1989 was 109 km\n\n3. Analysis:\n* There is a verifiable difference between the stated 90 km and the actual 109 km distance\n* This represents a significant discrepancy of 19 km\n* Historical records clearly document the 109 km distance for that specific year\n* The 90 km figure is definitively incorrect for 1989\n\n4. Verification:\n* The 109 km distance is well-documented in race archives and historical records\n* There were no shortened versions or alternative routes in 1989\n\nGiven that we can definitively show that the race distance in 1989 was 109 km, not 90 km, this creates a direct factual contradiction.\n\nREFUTED"], "evaluation": "f"}, {"metadata": {"topic": "Geography", "answer_type": "Place", "urls": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A1clav_Hlavat%C3%BD", "https://archives.iu.edu/catalog/InU-Li-VAD6524", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A1clav_Hlavat%C3%BD"]}, "problem": "What is the name of the city and state where V\u00e1clav Hlavat\u00fd, a Czech-American mathematician, died?", "answer": "Carmel, Indiana", "label": "f", "model_name": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", "timestamp": "2025-02-16T06:15:28.816524+00:00", "verification": ["Let me analyze this step by step:\n\n1.
