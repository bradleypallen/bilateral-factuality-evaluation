The answer provided is \"3,200.\" To evaluate this, we need to confirm the useful lift of the K-class blimp, particularly the K-14, and ensure it matches the stated value.\n\n2. **Check for any supporting facts**:  \n   The K-class blimps were non-rigid airships used by the U.S. Navy starting in 1938. They were primarily used for anti-submarine warfare and patrol missions during World War II. The useful lift of the K-class blimps is a documented specification. Sources indicate that the useful lift of the K-class blimps was approximately **7,000 pounds**, which converts to about **3,175 kilograms**. This is very close to the stated value of 3,200 kilograms.\n\n3. **Check for any contradictory facts**:  \n   There is no evidence to suggest that the useful lift of the K-class blimps, including the K-14, deviates significantly from the documented value of approximately 3,175 kilograms. The difference between 3,175 and 3,200 kilograms is negligible and likely due to rounding.\n\n4. **Consider question context for implied terms**:  \n   The question does not specify whether the value is an exact or approximate figure. Given the context, it is reasonable to interpret the answer as an approximate value, which aligns with the documented useful lift of the K-class blimps.\n\n5. **Note if any missing information is essential vs optional**:  \n   The exact useful lift of the K-14 model is not explicitly stated in the question or answer, but the K-class blimps as a whole are known to have a useful lift of approximately 3,175 kilograms. This is sufficient to verify the claim as accurate within the context of the question.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim that the K-class blimp (1938), the K-14, had a useful lift of 3,200 kilograms is **TRUE**, as the value is consistent with documented specifications for the K-class blimps.", "evaluation": "t"}, {"metadata": {"topic": "Music", "answer_type": "Date", "urls": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong#Early_life", "https://historydraft.com/story/louis-armstrong/arrested/288/1475", "https://dippermouth.blogspot.com/2014/12/louis-armstrong-and-colored-waifs-home.html"]}, "problem": "What day, month, and year was Louis Armstrong arrested and spent the night at New Orleans Juvenile Court?", "answer": "January 15, 1913", "label": "f", "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T18:22:24.085286+00:00", "reasoning": "### Reasoning:\n\n1. **Verify the essential information is present**:  \n   The question asks for the specific day, month, and year Louis Armstrong was arrested and spent the night at New Orleans Juvenile Court.
