While some sources mention Coligny's role as a secretary, others focus on his broader duties as an advisor and diplomat. \n\n3. **Unstated Assumptions:**\n\n* The answer assumes that \"secretary\" is a precise and universally understood role. In that era, such positions may have encompassed broader responsibilities than a modern secretary.\n\n4. **Temporal/Contextual Dependencies:**\n\n* The question doesn't specify a timeframe during Henri's governorship.
