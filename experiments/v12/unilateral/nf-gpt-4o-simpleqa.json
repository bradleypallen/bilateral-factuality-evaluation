First verify the essential information is present:\n   - The question asks about an animal that is 30 times more likely to get hit by lightning than a human.\n   - The answer provided is \"giraffe.\"\n\n2. Check for any supporting facts:\n   - Giraffes are the tallest land animals, which could make them more susceptible to lightning strikes due to their height.\n   - Lightning tends to strike taller objects because they are closer to the storm clouds.\n\n3. Check for any contradictory facts:\n   - There is no widely known or specific statistical data that confirms giraffes are exactly 30 times more likely to be struck by lightning compared to humans.\n   - While giraffes' height makes them more vulnerable, the exact multiplier (30 times) is not a commonly cited figure in scientific literature.\n\n4. Consider question context for implied terms:\n   - The context implies a comparison of likelihood between giraffes and humans regarding lightning strikes.\n   - The exact figure \"30 times\" is specific and requires precise verification.\n\n5. Note if any missing information is essential vs optional:\n   - Essential: Verification of the claim that giraffes are 30 times more likely to be struck by lightning than humans.\n   - Optional: General understanding that giraffes are more likely to be struck due to their height.\n\nConclusion:\n- The claim that giraffes are 30 times more likely to be struck by lightning than humans cannot be definitively verified with the available information.\n- While it is reasonable to assume giraffes are more likely to be struck due to their height, the specific figure \"30 times\" lacks supporting evidence.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\n\"FALSE\" - If any essential claim cannot be verified", "Reasoning steps:\n\n1.
