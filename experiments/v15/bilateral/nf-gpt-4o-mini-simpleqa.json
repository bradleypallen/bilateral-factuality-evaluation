The Palazzo della Cancelleria is indeed an important example of Renaissance architecture in Rome, but it is commonly regarded as being built between 1485 and 1515. However, the Palazzo Farnese, which was begun in 1514 and also exemplifies the Renaissance style, is often noted as having been constructed soon after the start of the Renaissance architectural movement in Rome.\n\nSome sources might argue that the earlier Palazzo Bartolini-Salimbene or other structures might fit the definition of the first Renaissance palace, depending on interpretations of which criteria define \"first.\"\n\nGiven the ambiguity and debate regarding which building can definitively be named the first in the Renaissance style in Rome, one cannot ascertain definitively that the Palazzo della Cancelleria is categorically distinguished in this way. \n\nSince we find competing views and a lack of consensus about which building holds the title of \"first,\" we cannot conclude that the assertion is definitively false.\n\nCANNOT REFUTE"

To evaluate if this answer is definitively FALSE, we must check if Jess Castellote is indeed associated with the Virtual Museum of Modern Nigerian Art.\n\nJess Castellote is known for his contributions to contemporary architecture and digital projects, including work related to African art. However, to claim definitively whether he is the creator of the Virtual Museum of Modern Nigerian Art would require specific evidence or documentation of his involvement.\n\nSince there is no definitive source that contradicts the claim of Jess Castellote's involvement or confirms it, we cannot definitively assert that the answer is FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is: \n\nCANNOT REFUTE",
