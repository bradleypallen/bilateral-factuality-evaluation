The key claim in the question is that the top religious body in Saudi Arabia gave the green light for codification of Sharia law in a specific year.\n2. To verify this claim, we need to identify the top religious body in Saudi Arabia and confirm that it gave the green light for codification of Sharia law in the specified year.\n3. The top religious body in Saudi Arabia is the Council of Senior Scholars (Majma' al-'Ulama' al-A'ala).\n4. A search for the codification of Sharia law in 2008 reveals that the Saudi Arabian government issued a royal decree in 2008 to establish the Supreme Court of Saudi Arabia, which is responsible for interpreting and applying Sharia law. However, it is not explicitly stated that the Council of Senior Scholars gave the green light for this codification.\n5. There are no unstated assumptions or temporal/contextual dependencies that would affect the validity of the claim.\n\nConclusion:\n\"CANNOT DETERMINE TRUE\" - The answer provided (2008) is the year when the Saudi Arabian government issued a royal decree to establish the Supreme Court of Saudi Arabia, which is responsible for interpreting and applying Sharia law.
