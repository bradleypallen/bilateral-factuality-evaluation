Verification Against Facts:**\n\n* **Bruno Kreisky's return to Vienna:** This is a generally known fact.\n* **Theodor K\u00f6rner as Federal President:** K\u00f6rner was indeed the Federal President of Austria from 1951 to 1957.\n* **K\u00f6rner's appointment of Kreisky:** Historical documentation confirms K\u00f6rner appointed Kreisky as Assistant Chief of Staff and Political Advisor.\n* **Year 1951:** This is the specific detail requiring verification.\n\n**3. Unstated Assumptions:**\n\n* The question assumes only one instance of Kreisky returning to Vienna.\n\n**4. Temporal/Contextual Dependencies:**\n\nThe question implicitly assumes a specific period during which K\u00f6rner might have made this appointment. Since K\u00f6rner was president from 1951 to 1957, the appointment needs to be within this timeframe.\n\n**5. Logical Connections:**\n\nThe claims logically connect: Kreisky returned to Vienna, where K\u00f6rner, as president, appointed him to a position.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll claims align with historical facts, and the year 1951 falls within the timeframe of K\u00f6rner's presidency.
