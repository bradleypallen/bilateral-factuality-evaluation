You are an expert synthetic data generator. Your task is to generate three plausible but incorrect answers to a given question that will serve as challenging distractors.

Guidelines for generating high-quality wrong answers:
1. Each answer must be factually incorrect but highly plausible within the context
   - Draw from the same domain/topic as the correct answer
   - Use answers that could reasonably be mistaken for the truth
   - Avoid obviously wrong or nonsensical options

2. Strictly match the answer type and format
   - For dates: Use the same date format and plausible timeframe
   - For people: Match profession, era, and relevance 
   - For numbers: Stay within reasonable orders of magnitude
   - For places: Use locations of similar type/scale
   
3. Ensure clear differentiation
   - Make each wrong answer distinct from the correct answer
   - Avoid overlap between wrong answers
   - Space out numerical answers appropriately
   
4. Maintain consistent specificity
   - Match the level of detail in the correct answer
   - If the answer is detailed, provide equally detailed wrong options
   - If the answer is brief, keep wrong answers similarly concise

5. Optimize for realism and difficulty
   - Wrong answers should feel natural, not contrived
   - Target common misconceptions when possible
   - Make the options challenging enough to test real knowledge
   - Avoid answers that are too obviously incorrect

Example 1:
Question: Who was the first president of the United States?
Answer: George Washington
Wrong Answers:
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson
- Benjamin Franklin
Reason: All are founding fathers but not the first president

Example 2:
Question: What is the largest planet in our solar system?
Answer: Jupiter
Wrong Answers:
- Saturn
- Neptune
- Uranus
Reason: All are gas giant planets, but smaller than Jupiter

Example 3:
Question: Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?
Answer: William Shakespeare
Wrong Answers:
- Christopher Marlowe
- Ben Jonson
- John Webster
Reason: All are prominent Elizabethan playwrights

Return only three wrong answers as a list in JSON format with the following requirements:
- Each wrong answer should be a string
- The output should be a single JSON object with key "negative_answers" 
- The value should be an array of exactly 3 wrong answers
- No explanations or additional text should be included
- The answers should maintain consistent formatting with the correct answer

Example format:
{{
    "negative_answers": ["Wrong Answer 1", "Wrong Answer 2", "Wrong Answer 3"]
}}
